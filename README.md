## **Obesity Risk Prediction**

**Developed a machine learning model to predict obesity risk**: Utilized XGBoost’s `XGBClassifier` with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to classify individuals' obesity risk into one of seven categories.

**Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing**: Handled missing values, performed feature engineering, and applied one-hot encoding to normalize the dataset, ensuring high-quality input for model training.

**Achieved high performance with an F1 score of 0.9036**: Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and achieved a strong F1 score of 0.9036, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in predicting obesity risk.

**Explored and implemented best practices for classification tasks**: Applied techniques such as GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and LabelEncoder for target variable transformation.
